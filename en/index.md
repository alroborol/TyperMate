    title: Why I Made TyperMate
    content: |
      macOS is powerful—but if you work in multiple languages, it can feel clunky. After learning my third language and switching between macOS and Windows at work, I wanted something better. So I built TyperMate to make input switching and navigation effortless.
      - **Fast, predictable switching** - Switch to any input source instantly with custom hotkeys. A clear popup shows exactly which input method you’re using—no guessing.
      - **Windows-style navigation** - Love shortcuts like Home/End to jump lines or Enter to open files? TyperMate brings these familiar behaviors to macOS.
      - **Clear input display** - Icons aren’t enough. See your input method as text for clarity—perfect for juggling multiple languages.
      - **Lightweight & private** - Runs fully offline. Your data stays on your Mac, always.
      - **Persistent input popup** - Never wonder what you're switching to—even if you use three or more languages.

    title: How TyperMate Solves Your Problems
    content: |
      ### Per-Input Hotkeys + Popup Confirmation
      Assign a global hotkey to any input source and switch instantly. A small, non-intrusive popup shows the active input method so you always know what you're typing with.

      ### Familiar Navigation & Finder Keys
      Optionally remap Home/End to jump to line start/end, and (in Finder) make Enter open files while F2 renames—so macOS can feel more like the workflow you expect.

      ### Launch At Login & Privacy-Focused
      Run at login for instant availability. TyperMate is lightweight, runs locally, and does not send data over the network.

      ### Internationalization (i18n)
      Use the app in your language — TyperMate supports localization.
