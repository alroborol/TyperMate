      ### Why TyperMate Matters to Me
      - **Fast, predictable switching:** Instantly switch to any input source with a custom hotkey and get a clear popup, so you always know which input method you're using.
      - **Familiar navigation:** I prefer Windows-style shortcuts—jump to the start or end of a line with Home/End, and open files with Enter. TyperMate brings these behaviors to macOS.
      - **Clear input method display:** Sometimes an icon isn’t enough—seeing the input method as text gives more clarity, especially when juggling multiple languages.
      - **Lightweight & private:** Runs fully offline—your data stays on your Mac.
      - **Persistent input popup:** Never wonder what you’re switching to if you speak three or more languages.

      - **Remap Home/End keys** to line start/end to match Windows/Linux behavior
      - **Remap Enter/F2 in Finder** — press Enter to open items and F2 to rename, matching common Windows behaviors

      - **Lightweight & private** — no network calls, focused on keyboard workflows
      - **Open source** and easy to customize

    title: How TyperMate Solves Your Problems
    content: |
      ### 🔥 Per-Input Hotkeys + Popup Confirmation
      Assign a global hotkey to any input source and switch instantly. A small, non-intrusive popup shows the active input method so you always know what you're typing with.

      ### ⌨️ Familiar Navigation & Finder Keys
      Optionally remap Home/End to jump to line start/end, and (in Finder) make Enter open files while F2 renames—so macOS can feel more like the workflow you expect.

      ### 🚀 Launch At Login & Privacy-Focused
      Run at login for instant availability. TyperMate is lightweight, runs locally, and does not send data over the network.

      ### 🌏 Internationalization (i18n)
      Use the app in your language — TyperMate supports localization.
